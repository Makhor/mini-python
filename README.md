# mini-python
A bunch of small (hopefully) one file python scripts that do simple, but useful stuff.

I'm making these mostly to learn Python but I thought that maybe someone might find them useful for reference or learning so, here you go.

# Usage
All the scripts tell you which dependencies they need, so just grab the script you want, install the dependencies and you're good to go.

# Requests
if you've got any reccomendations/ideas for a script, send them to me on Twitter at [@jorge_makhor](https://twitter.com/jorge_makhor)
